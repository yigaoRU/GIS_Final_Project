I used table join, spatial join, aggregation to subset data tables to reasonable sizes. Airport dataset has too many columns and plenty of null values. 

## Interactive Map: Continental-US Airport Distribution
The following interactive map shows the distribution of the major airports in Continental-US. Markers represent international airports(with international custom facilities). In the Midatlantic Region, I aggregated number of airports by county. The darker of the county is colored, the more airports it has.    

Highlight Features:    
1. Carto Positron and openstreetmap layers to control with Carto Positron as default;
2. 3-letter IATA code of the airport and county name tooltips shown on hover;
3. Pops-ups of location, elevation information on click;
4. folium Choropleth map as basemap/
