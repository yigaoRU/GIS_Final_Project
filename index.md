I used table join, spatial join, aggregation to subset data tables to reasonable sizes. Airport dataset has too many columns and plenty of null values. 

## Interactive Map: Continental-US Airport Distribution
The following interactive map shows the distribution of the major airports in Continental-US. Markers represent international airports(with international custom facilities). In the Midatlantic Region, I aggregated number of airports by county. The darker of the county is colored, the more airports it has.    

Highlight Features:    
1. Carto Positron and openstreetmap layers to control with Carto Positron as default;
2. 3-letter IATA code of the airport and county name tooltips shown on hover;
3. Pops-ups of location, elevation information on click;
4. folium Choropleth map as basemap.

Interesting Findings:
1. Most airports located near the coastline(Eastcoast, Westcoast and Southcoast);
2. States like South Dakota don't even have an international airport.

## Static Map: Continental-US Airport Distribution By State
Spatial join is used for this map.

Highlight Features:    
1. spatial join is adopted to dissove county boundaries;
2. Carto Positron as basemap
3. Properly-sized legends and titles with a 2x1 small multiple approach.

<!-- ![](static_map_airport_distribution_by_state.png | width=500) ![](static_map_airport_distribution_by_region.png | width=500) -->
Interesting findings:
1. Southern states and regions have more airports than northern ones, especially CA,TX,FL.(Because the climate is suitable to build airports?)
2. States or regions with large number of airports distribute closer to the US border.
3. Internation airport distribution usually follows all airport distribution(populaiton). In the midatlantic region,however, it shows the higher proportion of airports to be international. 

## Static Map: Relationship of Median Household Income and Airport Count in Midatlantic Region

Highlight Features:    
1. airport distribution layer from interactive map overlays census median income tract layer;
2. Carto Positron as basemap.

Interesting Findings:
1. Suffolk County, Long Island has the most number of airports countywide.
2. The counties with more airports tend to have higher median household income.
